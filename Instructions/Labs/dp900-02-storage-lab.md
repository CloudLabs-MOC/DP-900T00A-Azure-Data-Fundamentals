1. On the **Storage account** page, click on the **Create (1)** dropdown and select **Storage account (2)**.    

    ![](images/dp2-3.png)
    
1. Enter the following values on the  **Create a storage account**  page:
    
    - Subscription: **Leave default Azure subscription (1)**
    - Resource group:Choose the existing resource group **DP-900-Module2-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**
    - Storage account name: **str<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (3)**.
    - Region: **Select any available location (4)**.
    - Performance:  **Standard (5)**
    - Redundancy:  **Locally-redundant storage(LRS) (6)**
    - Click on **Next** thrice, to navigate to **Data protection** tab.

      ![](images/dp2-4.png)    
  
1. On the **Data protection** tab, in the  **Recovery**  section,  deselect all of the  **Enable soft delete... (1)**  options. These options retain deleted files for subsequent recovery, but can cause issues later and then click on **Review+create (2)**.

    ![](images/dp2-5.png)

#### Task 2 : Explore blob storage

In this task, you will create a blob container to store and manage data within your Azure Storage account.

1. Right click on the following link, https://aka.ms/product1.json, then click on **copy link** and then paste it on the browser. It will download the **product1.json** JSON file and press **Ctrl+S** to save it on your computer (you can save it in any folder - you'll upload it to blob storage later).

1. Select **Downloads (1)**, keep the file name as **product1 (2)** then make sure that **Save as type** is **JSON** and click on **Save (3)**.

    ![](images/dp2-7.png)
    
     >**Note:** If the JSON file is displayed in your browser, save the page as **product1.json**.
    
1. In the Azure portal page go to the newly created storage account for your storage container, on the left side, in the  **Data storage**  section, select  **Containers**.

    ![](images/dp2-8.png)
    
1. In the **Containers** page, select **&#65291; Container** and add a new container named **data (1)** with an anonymous access level of **Private (no anonymous access) (2)** and then click on **Create (3)**.

    ![](images/dp2-9.png)

1. When the  **data**  container has been created, verify that it's listed in the  **Containers**  page.

    ![](images/dp2-10.png)
    
1. Go back to the storage account, in the pane on the left side, in the top section, select  **Storage browser (1)**. In the storage browser page, select  **Blob containers (2)**.

    ![Screenshot of Azure Database for PostgreSQL deployment options](images/dp2-11.png)

    ![](images/dp2-12.png)
    
1.  Select  **＋ Add Directory**.

    ![](images/dp2-14.png)

1. Create a new directory named  **products** and click on **Ok**.

    ![](images/dp2-13.png)
    
1. In Storage Explorer, verify that the current view shows the contents of the  **products**  folder you just created - observe that the "breadcrumbs" at the top of the page reflect the path  **Blob containers > data > products**.

    ![](images/dp2-15.png)

1. In the breadcrumbs, select **data** to switch to the **data** container.

    ![](images/dp2-16.png)

1. Note that it does <u>not</u> contain a folder named **products**.

    ![](images/dp2-17.png)

     >**Note:** Folders in blob storage are virtual, and only exist as part of the path of a blob. Since the **products** folder contained no blobs, it isn't really there!
      
1. Use the  **⤒ Upload**  button to open the  **Upload blob**  panel.

    ![](images/dp2-18.png)
    
1. In the  **Upload blob**  panel, select the **Browse for files (1)**, navigate to **Dowloads (2)** then select **product1.json (3)** file you saved on your local computer previously and then click on **Open (4)**. 

    ![](images/dp2-19.png)

1. Then expand **Advanced (1)**  section, in the  **Upload to folder**  box, enter  **product_data (2)**  and select the  **Upload (3)**  button.

    ![](images/dp2-20.png)
    
1. Close the  **Upload blob**  panel if it's still open, and verify that a  **product_data**  virtual folder has been created in the  **data**  container.

    ![](images/dp2-21.png)
    
1. Select the  **product_data**  folder and verify that it contains the  **product1.json**  blob you uploaded.

1. Select the  **elipses(...)**  icon at the right-end of the folder, and note that it doesn't display any options. Folders in a flat namespace blob container are virtual, and can’t be managed.

    ![](images/dp2-23.png)
    
1. Use the  **X**  icon at the top right in the  **data**  page to close the page and return to the  **Containers**  page.
    

#### Task 3:  Explore Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

In this task, you will use Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 to organize and manage access to blobs with hierarchical folders. You will also leverage Azure Blob Storage to host distributed file systems for big data analytics platforms.

1.  Download the [product2.json](https://aka.ms/product2.json?azure-portal=true)  JSON file by right click on the following link, `https://aka.ms/product2.json` then select **Copy link** and then paste it on the browser.

1. Press **Ctrl+S** to save file on your computer in the same folder where you downloaded product1.json previously - you'll upload it to blob storage later.

1. Select **Downloads (1)**, keep the file name as **product2 (2)** then make sure that **Save as type** is **JSON** and click on **Save (3)**.

    ![](images/dp2-24.png)

1. In the pane on the left side, in the top section, select  **Storage browser (1)**  and navigate back to the root of your  **data (2)**  blob container, which still contains the  **product_data (3)**  folder.

    ![](images/dp2-25.png)

1. Select the  **product_data**  folder, and verify it still contains the  **product1.json**  file you uploaded previously.

    ![](images/dp2-26.png)
