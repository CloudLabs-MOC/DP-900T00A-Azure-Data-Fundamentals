## Exercise 1: Provision an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace

In this exercise, you'll use the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace to ingest and analyze some data.

The exercise is designed to familiarize you with some key elements of a modern data warehousing solution, not as a comprehensive guide to performing advanced data analysis with Azure Synapse Analytics. 

### Task 1: Explore an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Home** page, use the **&#65291; Create a resource** icon to create a new resource.
1. Search for *Azure Synapse Analytics*, and create a new **Azure Synapse Analytics** resource with the following settings and click  **Create**.

     - **Subscription**: Select **Azure subscription**
        - **Resource group**: Select **DP-900-Module-4-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.
        - **Managed resource group**: Leave Blank
     - **Workspace name**: Enter **synapse-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.
     - **Region**: Select resource group region.
      - **Select Data Lake Storage Gen 2**: From subscription
        - **Account name**: Click on Create new then enter **datalake<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.
        - **File system name**: Click on Create new then enter **fs<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

   > **Note**: A Synapse Analytics workspace requires two resource groups in your Azure subscription; one for resources you explicitly create, and another for managed resources used by the service. It also requires a Data Lake storage account in which to store data, scripts, and other artifacts.
    
1.  When you've entered these details, select **Review + create**, and then select **Create** to create the workspace.
1.   Wait for the workspace to be created - this may take five minutes or so.
1. When deployment is complete, go to the resource group that was created and notice that it contains your Synapse Analytics workspace and a Data Lake storage account.
1.  Select your Synapse workspace, and in its  **Overview**  page, in  **Open Synapse Studio**  card, select  **Open**  to open Synapse Studio in a new browser tab. Synapse Studio is a web-based interface that you can use to work with your Synapse Analytics workspace.
    
1.  On the left side of Synapse Studio, use the  **››**  icon to expand the menu - this reveals the different pages within Synapse Studio that you'll use to manage resources and perform data analytics tasks, as shown here:

     ![Image showing Synapse Studio expanded Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 hierarchy with the file storage for your Synapse workspace](images/synapse-storage-dp-900-lab4.png)
    

### Task 3 : Use a SQL pool to analyze data

Now that you've ingested some data into your workspace, you can use Synapse Analytics to query and analyze it. One of the most common ways to query data is to use SQL, and in Synapse Analytics you can use a  _SQL pool_  to run SQL code.

1.  In Synapse Studio, right-click the  **products.csv**  file in the file storage for your Synapse workspace, point to  **New SQL script**, and select  **Select TOP 100 rows**.
    
1.  In the  **SQL Script 1**  pane that opens, review the SQL code that has been generated, which should be similar to this:
    

    
    ```SQL
    -- This is auto-generated code
    SELECT
        TOP 100 *
    FROM
        OPENROWSET(
            BULK 'https://datalakexx.dfs.core.windows.net/fsxx/products.csv',
            FORMAT = 'CSV',
            PARSER_VERSION='2.0'
        ) AS [result]
    
    ```
    
    This code opens a rowset from the text file you imported and retrieves the first 100 rows of data.
    
1.  In the  **Connect to**  list, ensure  **Built-in**  is selected - this represents the built-in SQL Pool that was created with your workspace.
    
1.  On the toolbar, use the  **▷ Run**  button to run the SQL code, and review the results, which should look similar to this:
    
    ![Image showing the expanded Synapse Studio menu to manage resources and perform data analytics tasks](images/DP-900result(1).png)


1.  Note the results consist of four columns named C1, C2, C3, and C4; and that the first row in the results contains the names of the data fields. To fix this problem, add a HEADER_ROW = TRUE parameters to the OPENROWSET function as shown here (replacing  _datalakexx_  with **datalake<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** and  _fsxx_  with **fs<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** the names of your data lake storage account and file system), and then rerun the query:

    ```SQL
    SELECT
        TOP 100 *
    FROM
        OPENROWSET(
            BULK 'https://datalakexx.dfs.core.windows.net/fsxx/products.csv',
            FORMAT = 'CSV',
            PARSER_VERSION='2.0',
            HEADER_ROW = TRUE
        ) AS [result]
    ```

    Now the results look like this:

    ![Image showing the expanded Synapse Studio menu to manage resources and perform data analytics tasks](images/DP-900result(2).png)

    
    
1.  Modify the query as follows (replacing  _datalakexx_  with **datalake<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** and  _fsxx_  with **fs<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** the names of your data lake storage account and file system):
    

    ```SQL
    SELECT
        Category, COUNT(*) AS ProductCount
    FROM
        OPENROWSET(
            BULK 'https://datalakexx.dfs.core.windows.net/fsxx/products.csv',
            FORMAT = 'CSV',
            PARSER_VERSION='2.0',
            HEADER_ROW = TRUE
        ) AS [result]
    GROUP BY Category;
    ```

    
1.  Run the modified query, which should return a resultset that contains the number products in each category, like this:
    
    ![Image showing the expanded Synapse Studio menu to manage resources and perform data analytics tasks](images/DP-900result(3).png)
     
1.  In the  **Properties**  pane for  **SQL Script 1**, change the  **Name**  to  **Count Products by Category**. Then in the toolbar, select  **Publish**  to save the script.
    
1.  Close the  **Count Products by Category**  script pane.
    
1.  In Synapse Studio, select the  **Develop**  page, and notice that your published  **Count Products by Category**  SQL script has been saved there.
    
1.  Select the  **Count Products by Category**  SQL script to reopen it. Then ensure that the script is connected to the  **Built-in**  SQL pool and run it to retrieve the product counts.
    
1.  In the  **Results**  pane, select the  **Chart**  view, and then select the following settings for the chart:
    
     -   **Chart type**: Column
     -   **Category column**: Category
     -   **Legend (series) columns**: ProductCount
     -   **Legend position**: bottom - center
     -   **Legend (series) label**:  _Leave blank_
     -   **Legend (series) minimum value**:  _Leave blank_
     -   **Legend (series) maximum**:  _Leave blank_
     -   **Category label**:  _Leave blank_
    
     The resulting chart should resemble this:
    
     ![Image showing the product count chart view](images/column-chart-dp-900-lab4.png)
    

### Task 4 : Use a Spark pool to analyze data

While SQL is a common language for querying structured datasets, many data analysts find languages like Python useful to explore and prepare data for analysis. In Azure Synapse Analytics, you can run Python (and other) code in a  _Spark pool_; which uses a distributed data processing engine based on Apache Spark.

1. In Synapse Studio, select the **Manage** page.
1. Select the **Apache Spark pools** tab, and then use the **&#65291; New** icon to create a new Spark pool with the following settings:
    - **Apache Spark pool name**: Enter **spark<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.
    - **Node size family**: Memory Optimized
    - **Node size**: Small (4 vCores / 32 GB)
    - **Autoscale**: Enabled
    - **Number of nodes** 3----3
   
1. Review and create the Spark pool, and then wait for it to deploy (which may take a few minutes).
1. When the Spark pool has been deployed, in Synapse Studio, on the **Data** page, browse to the file system for your Synapse workspace. Then right-click **products.csv**, point to **New notebook**, and select **Load to DataFrame**.
1. In the **Notebook 1** pane that opens, in the **Attach to** list, select the **spark** Spark pool to created previously and ensure that the **Language** is set to **PySpark (Python)**.
1. Review the code in the first (and only) cell in the notebook, which should look like this:

    ```Python
    %%pyspark
    df = spark.read.load('abfss://fsxx@datalakexx.dfs.core.windows.net/products.csv', format='csv'
    ## If header exists uncomment line below
    ##, header=True
    )
    display(df.limit(10))
    
    ```

    
1.  Use the  **▷**  icon to the left of the code cell to run it, and wait for the results. The first time you run a cell in a notebook, the Spark pool is started - so it may take a minute or so to return any results.
    
    > **Note**: 
    If an error occurs because the Python Kernel isn't available yet, run the cell again.

1.  Eventually, the results should appear below the cell, and they should be similar to this:
    
    ![Image showing the product count chart view](images/DP-900result(4).png)
    
1.  Uncomment the  **header=True**  line (because the products.csv file has the column headers in the first line), so your code looks like this:
    
   
    ```Python
    %%pyspark
    df = spark.read.load('abfss://fsxx@datalakexx.dfs.core.windows.net/products.csv', format='csv'
    ## If header exists uncomment line below
    , header=True
    )
    display(df.limit(10))
    
    ```
    >**Note**: Modify the query as follows (replacing  _fsxx_ with **fs<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** and _datalakexx_ with **datalake<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** the names of your data lake storage account and file system):


1.  Rerun the cell and verify that the results look like this:
    
    ![Image showing the product count chart view](images/DP-900result(5).png)
    
    > Notice that running the cell again takes less time, because the Spark pool is already started.
    
1.  Under the results, use the  **＋ Code**  icon to add a new code cell to the notebook.
    
1.  In the new empty code cell, add the following code:

    ```Python
    df_counts = df.groupby(df.Category).count()
    display(df_counts)
    ```
    
1.  Run the new code cell by clicking its  **▷**  icon, and review the results, which should look similar to this:

       ![Image showing category count chart view](images/DP-900result(6).png) 
     
1.  In the results output for the cell, select the  **Chart**  view. The resulting chart should resemble this:
    
     ![Image showing category count chart view](images/bar-chart-dp-900-lab4.png)
    
1.  Close the  **Notebook 1**  pane and discard your changes.
